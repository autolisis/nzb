# nzb

A beautiful CLI front-end for Nozbe written in Rust.

A work in progress. It is planned to be as feature-rich as the excellent [Wunderline](https://github.com/wayneashleyberry/wunderline) app for Wunderlist.



### Installation

Make sure you have the latest (stable) versions of Cargo and/or Rustup installed.

Then, simply run

```bash
cargo install
```

in the base directory.
