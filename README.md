# nzb

A beautiful CLI front-end for Nozbe written in Rust.

A work in progress. It is planned to be as feature-rich as the excellent [Wunderline](https://github.com/wayneashleyberry/wunderline) app for Wunderlist.

### Installation

Make sure you have the latest (stable) versions of Cargo and/or Rustup installed.

#### From Cargo

```bash
cargo install nzb
```

#### From Binaries

Binary releases can be found at the [Releases](https://gitlab.com/reisub0/nzb/tags) page.

TODO:

1. Add better Authentication mechanism (uname + pw)
2. Add search feature
3. Add feature for adding links directly to comments + task name
4. Get counts of inbox items
